# Featherweight Project Knowledge Base
*Last Updated: 2025-06-03*

## 🎯 Project Vision
**Super App for Weightlifting** - Combining best features from Hevy, Boostcamp, Juggernaut.ai, KeyLifts
- Goal: Iteratively build amazing weightlifting tracking app
- Platform: Android (Kotlin + Compose)
- Approach: Start with core features, expand systematically

## 🏗️ Current Technical Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Material3
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with Repository
- **Database**: Room (SQLite) with fallback destructive migration
- **Navigation**: Bottom Navigation (3 tabs implemented)
- **Dependency Injection**: None yet (consider Hilt later)

## 📊 Current Data Model (Room Database v4)
```kotlin
// Core entities with relationships
Workout (id, date, notes)
↓ 1:many
ExerciseLog (id, workoutId, exerciseName, exerciseOrder, supersetGroup?, notes?)
↓ 1:many
SetLog (id, exerciseLogId, setOrder, reps, weight, rpe?, tag?, notes?, isCompleted, completedAt?)

// Key features in data model:
- Foreign key cascades (delete workout = delete all exercises/sets)
- Set completion tracking with timestamps
- RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) support
        - Flexible notes/tags system
- Superset grouping capability
- Workout completion state ([COMPLETED] marker in notes)
```

## 📱 Current UI State & Features
### Implemented Navigation:
**Bottom Navigation (3 tabs)**:
- 🏠 **Home** - Dashboard with quick stats, in-progress workouts, recent activity
- 🏋️ **Workout** - Active workout tracking (center/primary tab)
- 📊 **History** - Past workouts with completion status

### Implemented Screens:
1. **HomeScreen** - Enhanced dashboard
   - Quick stats (streak, volume, duration)
   - Primary action buttons (Start Freestyle/Browse Templates)
   - In-progress workout resumption
   - Recent workout preview
   - Weekly progress tracking
   - Daily motivational tips

2. **WorkoutScreen** - Full workout tracking system
   - Active/completed workout states with read-only mode
   - Edit mode for completed workouts (temporary editing)
   - Add/edit/delete exercises and sets
   - Inline set editing (click to edit reps, weight, RPE)
   - Set completion validation (requires reps + weight)
   - "Complete All Sets" button per exercise
   - Progress tracking with visual indicators
   - Smart suggestions based on exercise history
   - Workout completion flow
   - Workout naming functionality

3. **HistoryScreen** - Workout history management
   - List of all workouts (completed + in-progress)
   - Visual distinction between completed/in-progress
   - Workout stats (exercises, sets, volume)
   - Seed data for testing

### Technical Implementation Details:
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access with FeatherweightRepository
- **Smart State Management**: Complex workout state with edit mode support
- **Modular UI Components**: Reusable cards, dialogs, and input components
- **Material3 Theming**: Comprehensive design system
- **Data Validation**: Set completion requires both reps and weight
- **Edit Mode System**: Temporary editing of completed workouts with save/discard

- [x] Exercise history tracking
- [x] Copy last set functionality
- [x] Set validation (reps + weight required)

### Data Management:
- [x] Workout state persistence
- [x] In-progress workout detection
- [x] Completed workout read-only mode
- [x] Edit mode for completed workouts
- [x] Seed data for testing/development

### UI/UX Polish:
- [x] Progress indicators
- [x] Visual feedback for completed sets
- [x] Empty states
- [x] Confirmation dialogs
- [x] Loading states
- [x] Error handling

## 🐛 Known Bugs & Issues

### High Priority - Set Completion Validation:
1. **Missing Error Tooltip**: When user tries to complete invalid sets (no reps/weight), no visual feedback shows
2. **Complete All Behavior**: "Complete All" only completes valid sets, should show validation message for invalid ones
3. **Validation Message Logic**: The warning card doesn't always appear when expected

### Medium Priority:
4. **Edit Mode Polish**: Could improve UX for save/discard workflow
5. **Navigation State**: Back press handling during edit mode needs refinement
6. **Progress Calculation**: Some edge cases in progress percentage calculation

### Low Priority:
7. **Performance**: No optimization done yet (fine for current scope)
8. **Testing**: No unit/integration tests yet
9. **Error Handling**: Could be more comprehensive for edge cases

## 🎯 Next Immediate Priorities

### Phase 1 - Bug Fixes (Current Focus):
- [ ] Fix set completion validation feedback
- [ ] Improve "Complete All" validation messaging
- [ ] Polish validation warning display logic
- [ ] Test edge cases in set completion flow

### Phase 2 - Core Enhancement:
- [ ] Add Analytics/Progress tab
- [ ] Add Profile/Settings tab
- [ ] Rest timer between sets
- [ ] Workout duration tracking
- [ ] Exercise library with instructions

### Phase 3 - Smart Features:
- [ ] Workout templates system
- [ ] Auto-populate weights from last workout
- [ ] RPE-based recommendations
- [ ] Bodyweight/measurements tracking
- [ ] PR (Personal Record) detection

## 🎨 Design Philosophy & Patterns
- **Material3 Design Language**: Modern, accessible, consistent
- **Fitness-focused Color Palette**: Blue primary, green for success/completion
- **Train-Centric Navigation**: Workout tab is the hero feature
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable cards, inline editing
- **Smart Defaults**: Auto-suggestions, copy last set
- **Instant Feedback**: Real-time validation, completion states
- **Thumb-friendly**: Bottom navigation, large touch targets

## 💾 Key Code Patterns & Architecture

### Repository Pattern:
```kotlin
class FeatherweightRepository {
   suspend fun getSmartSuggestions(exerciseName: String, currentWorkoutId: Long): SmartSuggestions?
   suspend fun getWorkoutHistory(): List<WorkoutSummary>
   suspend fun getOngoingWorkout(): Workout?
}
```

### Workout State Management:
```kotlin
data class WorkoutState(
   val isActive: Boolean,
   val isCompleted: Boolean,
   val isInEditMode: Boolean,
   val originalWorkoutData: Triple<List<ExerciseLog>, List<SetLog>, String?>?
)
```

### Validation Logic:
```kotlin
fun canMarkSetComplete(set: SetLog): Boolean = set.reps > 0 && set.weight > 0
```

### Component Architecture:
- Modular screen components (HomeScreen, WorkoutScreen, HistoryScreen)
- Reusable UI components (ExerciseCard, SetRow, ProgressCard)
- Smart dialogs with suggestions (SmartEditSetDialog)
- Validation and feedback systems

## 🔄 Context Bootstrapping Instructions
When starting new conversation:
1. Reference this knowledge base file
2. Current focus: **Fixing set completion validation bugs**
3. We have 3-tab bottom navigation working (Home/Workout/History)
4. Core workout tracking is solid, working on polish and bug fixes
5. Next major milestone: Complete validation fixes, then add Analytics tab
