# Robolectric Configuration
# ========================
#
# This file configures Robolectric for all unit tests in the project.
#
# SDK VERSION SELECTION
# ---------------------
# sdk=28 (Android 9 / Pie) is used because:
# 1. STABILITY: SDK 28 is the most thoroughly tested and stable Robolectric target.
#    Higher SDK levels (29+) can cause native library crashes in CI environments.
# 2. CI COMPATIBILITY: Avoids JVM crashes in GitHub Actions due to Robolectric's
#    native code initialization on newer SDK targets.
# 3. COVERAGE: Our app minSdk is 26, and 28 provides sufficient API coverage for
#    testing core functionality without compatibility layer issues.
# 4. PERFORMANCE: SDK 28 has faster test execution compared to 29+ due to reduced
#    native library overhead.
#
# When to consider changing:
# - If you need to test APIs introduced in SDK 29+, use @Config(sdk = [29]) per-test
# - Monitor Robolectric releases for improved stability on newer SDKs
#
sdk=28

# LOOPER MODE
# -----------
# LEGACY mode is used for compatibility with existing coroutine-based tests.
# PAUSED mode can cause issues with suspending functions and Flow collection.
# Can be overridden with @LooperMode annotation per test if needed.
looperMode=LEGACY
