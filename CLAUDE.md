We are building a weightlifting Super App, that combines the best that other best-in-class apps have
to offer. Think of things like Boostcamp, Juggernaut.ai, KeyLifts, Hevy.

Our goal is to iteratively build an amazing app.

Some features are:

- The ability to track workouts, in terms of exercises, sets, reps, RPE, time/duration, etc.
- Workout history tracker
- Profile creation and management
- Social aspect (thing the Duolingo of weightlifting)
- AI assistance, with things like auto-regulation, depending on how hard an exercise was
- Wide range of exercises, potentially dynamically sourced and maintained, with video/image
  explanations of how to perform them, as well as brief documentation of what muscles they target
- Analytics/trends across the board
- Ability to either start an empty workout, or use a template
- Quality of life improvements like pre-populating weights with previously used once
- Body weight + measurements tracking

We are starting with Android and I am using Android Studio with Kotlin Compose for the codebase,
which is already available in your context.

We are using .md files such as EXERCISES.md to keep track of vision and ongoing work across
different sub-domains.
