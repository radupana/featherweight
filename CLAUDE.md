## Project Background

Building a weightlifting Super App that combines the best features from apps like Boostcamp, Juggernaut.ai, KeyLifts, and Hevy. Focus on iterative development to create an amazing user experience.

## Technical Architecture

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (Material Design 3) 
- **Design System**: Athletic Elegance with glassmorphism (light theme only)
- **Database**: Room with SQLite v17 (destructive migration)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository layer
- **Navigation**: Single-Activity with enum-based routing
- **Async**: Coroutines and Flow with Dispatchers.IO
- **Animations**: Spring-based with haptic feedback

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Features ✅

- **Exercise Database**: 112 exercises with full metadata - ALL using singular naming convention
- **Programme System**: Popular templates (531, StrongLifts, Upper/Lower, nSuns) with 1RM setup
- **Workout Tracking**: Real-time set completion, smart weight input, programme integration
- **Analytics**: Interactive charts (tappable volume bars), Quick Stats, Big 4 focus
- **History**: Paginated with long-tap delete, edit mode for completed workouts
- **Smart Features**: Auto-populate weights, swipe-to-delete sets, programme progress tracking

### Programme System Details

- **Templates**: Starting Strength, StrongLifts 5x5, Upper/Lower Split, Wendler's 531, nSuns 531
- **Setup Flow**: 1RM input for main lifts with robust decimal handling
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress cards, completed/total workouts, percentage display
- **Exercise Validation**: All programme exercises auto-created if missing from database

### Recent Improvements

- ✅ Fixed navigation to return to correct screen (HOME/HISTORY)
- ✅ Added long-tap delete for workouts across all screens
- ✅ Fixed 1RM input UX using TextFieldValue with proper cursor control
- ✅ Replaced all placeholder exercises with real names
- ✅ Standardized ALL exercises to singular form (Pull-up, not Pull-ups)
- ✅ Fixed programme progress race condition with proper refresh on navigation
- ✅ Ensured programme workouts only use persisted exercises
- ✅ Implemented drag-and-drop reordering for workout exercises
- ✅ Added compact exercise cards with drag handles for better space utilization  
- ✅ Fixed LazyColumn key-based item identity issues affecting drag state
- ✅ Added exercise frequency tracking with usage count in database
- ✅ Implemented frequency-based sorting in exercise selection (most used first)
- ✅ Added discrete usage count display (e.g., "5×") on exercise selection cards

## Key Files & Architecture

**Data Layer:**
- `FeatherweightDatabase.kt` - Room v17 with destructive migration
- `FeatherweightRepository.kt` - Central data access, programme workout creation, usage tracking
- `ExerciseSeeder.kt` - 112 exercises (all singular names)
- `ProgrammeSeeder.kt` - Programme templates with real exercises
- `ExerciseDao.kt` - Exercise queries with frequency-based sorting (usageCount DESC, name ASC)

**Programme Components:**
- `ProgrammesScreen.kt` - Template browser with filters
- `ActiveProgrammeScreen.kt` - Active programme management with delete
- `ProgrammeSetupDialog.kt` - 1RM input with proper weight validation
- `ProgrammeViewModel.kt` - Programme state management with refreshData()

**Workout Components:**
- `WorkoutScreen.kt` - Main interface with programme context, drag-and-drop reordering
- `SetEditingModal.kt` - Full-screen modal with swipe-to-delete
- `CompactExerciseCard.kt` - Compact card with drag handle, progress metrics
- `DragHandleReorderableUtils.kt` - Drag handle component with visual feedback

**Exercise Selection:**
- `ExerciseSelectorScreen.kt` - Exercise browser with frequency-based sorting and usage indicators
- `ExerciseCard.kt` - Shows usage count badge when > 0, maintains visual hierarchy

## Important Implementation Details

### Exercise Naming Convention
- ALL exercises use singular form: "Barbell Curl" not "Barbell Curls"
- Database enforces this through v17 migration
- Historical workouts wiped and re-seeded with correct names

### Exercise Usage Tracking
- `usageCount` field automatically incremented when exercise is logged
- Exercise selection sorted by frequency (usageCount DESC, name ASC)
- Usage counts calculated from both real workouts and seeded test data
- Discrete badge display shows "×" format only when count > 0

### Programme Workouts
- Sequential day numbering (1,2,3,4) regardless of week days
- Automatic exercise creation if not in database
- Intelligent categorization based on exercise name
- Programme progress refreshes on screen navigation

### Input Handling
- Weight inputs use TextFieldValue with TextRange for cursor control
- Auto-select on focus for easy replacement
- Validation: reps ≤ 999, weight ≤ 9999.99, RPE ≤ 10.0

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- Long-press drag handles to initiate reordering
- Smooth animations using tween with FastOutSlowInEasing
- Real-time position updates from ViewModel state (critical for LazyColumn with keys)
- 60% hysteresis threshold prevents jittery movement
- Haptic feedback on drag start
- Visual feedback: elevation, opacity changes, and color highlights

## Common Commands

- Lint: `./gradlew lint`
- Build: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Install: `./gradlew installDebug`

## Next Priority Issues

1. **Analytics Text Overflow**: 
   - "Latest PR" card needs to show exercise name clearly
   - "Training Frequency" shows "4.0 days/" - needs full "days/week"

2. **Programme Enhancement**:
   - Exercise substitution UI
   
3. **Profile Screen**:
   - Test user selection implementation
   - User stats and settings management

## Future Milestones

### AI Programme Import
- LLM integration for converting AI text to structured programmes
- Exercise name fuzzy matching
- User review before activation
- 5 imports/month quota

### Social Features
- Workout sharing
- Community challenges
- Leaderboards

### Advanced Analytics
- ML-powered insights
- Plateau detection
- Form video analysis

## Development Guidelines

- No comments unless explaining complex logic
- Follow Material Design 3 consistently
- Test edge cases (empty states, long text, errors)
- Atomic commits with descriptive messages
- Update CLAUDE.md for architectural changes

## Known Technical Gotchas

### LazyColumn with Keys
- When using `key` parameter, item composables maintain identity across recompositions
- Drag handlers can capture stale state references - always access current state from ViewModel
- Use `items()` instead of `itemsIndexed()` when indices need dynamic calculation

### State Management in Drag Operations
- Exercise order must be updated both in UI state and database
- Use `copy()` to ensure immutable updates with correct exerciseOrder values
- Database updates should be async to maintain smooth UI animations

### Compose Recomposition
- Heavy logging in frequently recomposing components impacts performance
- Use `derivedStateOf` for expensive calculations based on changing state
- Remember to clean up drag state completely on drag end to prevent inconsistencies

### Database Development Strategy
- Using `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` during development for simplicity
- All data is re-seeded on schema changes to avoid migration complexity
- Usage counts are recalculated after seeding to ensure accurate frequency data
