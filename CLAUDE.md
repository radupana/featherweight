## System prompts

Apply critical thinking and give me your objective assessment of the viability of ideas. Play the
role of a skeptical team member who's job it is to play devil's advocate. Provide honest, balanced
feedback without excessive praise or flattery.

Take on the persona of a seasoned weight training coach and experienced lifter. Challenge my
proposals and ideas without flattering me constantly. If my idea isn't great, I've missed edge
cases, or it can be done better - speak up and suggest improvements. Don't blindly agree with me.
Your experience should guide our technical decisions.

## Project Overview

Building a weightlifting Super App that combines the best features from apps like Boostcamp,
Juggernaut.ai, KeyLifts, and Hevy. Focus on iterative development to create an amazing user
experience.

**Target Audience**: Intermediate and advanced lifters. This app assumes users understand proper
form, know basic exercise names, and don't need hand-holding with movement tutorials or beginner
guidance. We won't include exercise videos, detailed form guides, or basic lifting education
features.

**Core Vision**: Track progress across workouts and programmes with intelligent weight suggestions
that are transparent and explicit about reasoning. Always show WHY a weight was suggested.

## Technical Architecture

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (Material Design 3)
- **Design System**: Athletic Elegance with glassmorphism (light theme only)
- **Database**: Room with SQLite (destructive migration during development)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository layer
- **Navigation**: Single-Activity with enum-based routing
- **Async**: Coroutines and Flow with Dispatchers.IO

## Documentation Strategy

**ALWAYS** use Context7 for the latest documentation and APIs for:
- Kotlin language features and standard library
- Jetpack Compose components and Material Design 3
- Android SDK and framework APIs
- Room database and SQLite
- Coroutines and Flow
- Any third-party libraries in our tech stack

Context7 provides up-to-date, accurate documentation that supersedes any knowledge cutoff limitations. When implementing features or debugging issues, always:
1. Call `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to find the correct library ID
2. Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to fetch current documentation
3. Implement according to the latest APIs and best practices from Context7

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Features ✅

- **Exercise Database**: 500 curated exercises with consistent naming
- **Programme System**: Templates with 1RM setup and progressive overload  
- **Workout Tracking**: Real-time set completion, smart weight input, exercise swapping
- **AI Programme Generation**: Real OpenAI integration with template library
- **Analytics System**: Charts, history, PR detection, achievements (37 total), insights engine

## Key Files & Architecture

### Key Services
- `FreestyleIntelligenceService` - Trend analysis and weight suggestions
- `GlobalProgressTracker` - Cross-workout progress tracking  
- `PRDetectionService` - Real-time PR detection with Brzycki formula
- `AchievementDetectionService` - 37 achievements across 4 categories
- `InsightGenerationService` - Data-driven training insights
- `WorkoutSeedingService` - Dev tool for generating test data with full analytics
- `WeightFormatter` - Unified formatting (quarter rounding, 2 decimal max)

## Development Guidelines

- **Foundation First**: Make it work for one case perfectly before expanding
- **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: No mock fallbacks or degraded functionality
- **Clean Code Maintenance**: Remove unused code, imports, and dead declarations
- **No Half-Ass Implementations**: Complete features properly across ALL impacted components
- **Transparent Logic**: Every weight calculation must be explainable to users
- **No Phased Planning**: Provide minimal planning and code to fix the problem at hand completely. Never give "phase 1, phase 2" or "now and later" approaches. Solve it properly in one go.
- **No Week-Based Timelines**: We don't do "Week 1, Week 2" planning. We implement everything as quickly as possible, ideally in a day.
- **No Future Enhancements Sections**: Focus only on the immediate task at hand. Don't add "Future Enhancements" or "Later Improvements" sections unless explicitly requested.
- **ALWAYS Compile Before Completion**: Never say "Implementation Complete" or "Done" without first compiling the code. Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` to ensure everything builds successfully.

## Common Commands

- Build: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Lint: `./gradlew lint`
- Install: `./gradlew installDebug`

## Database Strategy

- **DESTRUCTIVE MIGRATIONS ALWAYS** - We use `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` 
- **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY** - This is development. We nuke and rebuild as needed
- **NO PRODUCTION CONCERNS** - Break whatever needs breaking. Database gets wiped on every schema change
- Modify existing entities directly - no V2 classes or versioning
- Progressive overload data stored in JSON fields for flexibility

## Exercise Naming Standards (CRITICAL)

Our database has 500 exercises with the following strict naming conventions:

### Exercise Names
- **Equipment First**: Always start with equipment (Barbell, Dumbbell, Cable, Machine, Bodyweight)
- **Proper Case**: Each word capitalized (e.g., "Barbell Bench Press")
- **No Hyphens**: Use spaces not hyphens (e.g., "Step Up" NOT "Step-Up")
- **SINGULAR Forms**: When muscle names appear in exercise names, use SINGULAR:
  - ✅ "Cable Tricep Pushdown" (NOT "Cable Triceps Pushdown")
  - ✅ "Barbell Bicep Curl" (NOT "Barbell Biceps Curl")
  - ✅ "Dumbbell Calf Raise" (NOT "Dumbbell Calves Raise")
- **SINGULAR Movements**: Always singular form for movements:
  - ✅ "Curl" NOT "Curls"
  - ✅ "Row" NOT "Rows"
  - ✅ "Raise" NOT "Raises"

### Muscle Group Metadata
- **PLURAL Forms**: The `muscleGroup` field uses PLURAL forms:
  - ✅ muscleGroup: "Triceps" (NOT "Tricep")
  - ✅ muscleGroup: "Biceps" (NOT "Bicep")
  - ✅ muscleGroup: "Quadriceps", "Hamstrings", "Glutes", "Calves"

### Examples from Database
```
Exercise Name: "Cable Tricep Pushdown"
Muscle Group: "Triceps"

Exercise Name: "Barbell Bicep Curl"
Muscle Group: "Biceps"

Exercise Name: "Dumbbell Calf Raise"
Muscle Group: "Calves"
```

This convention is consistent across all 500 exercises. When AI generates exercise names, it must follow these exact patterns.

## Latest Updates (January 2025)

### Workout Seeding & Analytics Integration
- Seeded workouts now process through complete analytics flow (was creating data without analytics)
- Fixed by creating workouts as IN_PROGRESS then calling completeWorkout() to trigger all services
- Ensures PR detection, insights generation, and achievement unlocking work for test data

### UI Cleanup & Standards
- **No Placeholders Policy**: Removed all non-functional UI elements (Share button, insight actions)
- **Weight Formatting**: Unified display with WeightFormatter (rounds to quarter, max 2 decimals)
- **Filter Fixes**: Insights filtering now properly applies to both actionable and regular insights

## Critical Architecture Lessons

### Database Field Usage
- **ALWAYS** verify which fields the UI is updating vs validation checking
- `actualReps`/`actualWeight` = what user did (UI updates these)
- `targetReps`/`targetWeight` = what programme prescribed
- `reps`/`weight` = legacy fields, being phased out
- 157/500 exercises have `requiresWeight=false` (all bodyweight exercises)

### Set Input UI Architecture
```
[Exercise Name Header]
[Previous Performance Card] ← Shows last workout: "3 × 5×100kg @8"
[Rest Timer Bar]
[Set Input Table]
  | Target | Weight | Reps | RPE | ✓ |
  | 5×80   |   [ ]  | [ ]  | [ ] | □ |  ← Programme workout
  |        |   [ ]  | [ ]  | [ ] | □ |  ← Freestyle workout
```

### Key Validation Patterns
- Check `sets.any { !it.isCompleted && it.actualReps > 0 }` for "Complete All" visibility
- Always store `TextFieldValue` for cursor preservation in inputs
- Cache async validation results in `_setCompletionValidation`
- History query must include: `workout.status == COMPLETED || exercises.isNotEmpty()`

### UI/UX Principles
- **Remove before adding**: Question every UI element's purpose
- **Consistent layouts**: Same structure for all contexts (programme/freestyle)
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Read-only data looks different from editable
- **No redundant information**: Show data once in the right place
- **Image constraints**: Logos with padding don't scale well in TopAppBar

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **NO PLACEHOLDER UI** - Every button must do something or be removed
2. Don't show the same information in multiple places
3. Always test with both weighted and bodyweight exercises
4. Verify database saves are actually happening (check logs)
5. Canvas elements can't handle clicks - use overlay components
6. Seeded workouts must trigger full analytics flow (not just DB inserts)
