## Important Implementation Details

### Exercise Naming Convention
- ALL exercises use singular form: "Barbell Curl" not "Barbell Curls"
- Database enforces this through v17 migration
- Historical workouts wiped and re-seeded with correct names

### Exercise Usage Tracking
- `usageCount` field automatically incremented when exercise is logged
- Exercise selection sorted by frequency (usageCount DESC, name ASC)
- Usage counts calculated from both real workouts and seeded test data
- Discrete badge display shows "Ã—" format only when count > 0

### Rest Timer System
- **Auto-start**: 90s timer triggers when completing any set in WorkoutScreen
- **UI**: Floating pill at top center with glassmorphism design
- **Controls**: Tap to expand â†’ +30s, -30s, Skip buttons with exercise name display
- **State**: Managed by RestTimerViewModel with coroutines and Flow for countdown
- **Integration**: Currently works in WorkoutScreen, auto-starts from SetEditingModal callbacks

### Programme Workouts
- Sequential day numbering (1,2,3,4) regardless of week days
- Automatic exercise creation if not in database
- Intelligent categorization based on exercise name
- Programme progress refreshes on screen navigation

### Input Handling
- Weight inputs use TextFieldValue with TextRange for cursor control
- Auto-select on focus for easy replacement
- Validation: reps â‰¤ 999, weight â‰¤ 9999.99, RPE â‰¤ 10.0

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- Long-press drag handles to initiate reordering
- Smooth animations using tween with FastOutSlowInEasing
- Real-time position updates from ViewModel state (critical for LazyColumn with keys)
- 60% hysteresis threshold prevents jittery movement
- Haptic feedback on drag start
- Visual feedback: elevation, opacity changes, and color highlights

## Common Commands

- Lint: `./gradlew lint`
- Build: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Install: `./gradlew installDebug`

## Next Priority Issues

1. **Rest Timer Enhanced Features** (Phase 3):
   - **High**: Add user preferences for auto-start toggle and default rest periods
   - **Medium**: Enhanced feedback with haptic pulse and sound when timer completes
   - **Medium**: Background persistence using WorkManager for cross-screen timer continuity
   - **Low**: Exercise database integration for more precise categorization

2. **Analytics Text Overflow**: 
   - "Latest PR" card needs to show exercise name clearly
   - "Training Frequency" shows "4.0 days/" - needs full "days/week"

3. **Programme Enhancement**:
   - Exercise substitution UI
   
4. **Profile Screen**:
   - Test user selection implementation
   - User stats and settings management

## Rest Timer Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed (Phase 1, 2 & Smart Features)
- **Core Architecture**: Timer domain logic with countdown and progress tracking
- **State Management**: RestTimerViewModel with coroutines and smart suggestion integration
- **UI Components**: Main RestTimerPill with glassmorphism design and expandable controls
- **Compact Component**: CompactRestTimer for modal contexts with simplified exercise type display
- **Smart Auto-start**: Intelligent timer suggestions based on exercise categorization and set intensity
- **Exercise Intelligence**: 
  - Compound movements: 4 minutes base (Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press)
  - Accessory exercises: 2 minutes base (Rows, Overhead Press)
  - Isolation work: 90 seconds base (Curls, Extensions)
  - Cardio movements: 60 seconds base (Burpees, Sprints)
- **Intensity Adjustments**: Heavy sets (+30%), Light sets (-20%) based on rep ranges
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows exercise type reasoning (e.g., "Compound â€¢ Heavy", "Isolation")
- **Manual Controls**: +30s, -30s, Skip Rest buttons with haptic feedback
- **Optimal Positioning**: Timer appears below action buttons in WorkoutScreen, compact in SetEditingModal
- **Transparency**: Expanded pill fully opaque, collapsed semi-transparent for glassmorphism
- **Cross-screen Integration**: Timer visible with appropriate UI in both WorkoutScreen and SetEditingModal
- **Animation**: Smooth expand/shrink animations that respect content flow

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3 Priorities (Enhanced Features)
- **User Preferences**: Settings for auto-start toggle, default rest periods per exercise type
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Haptic pulse and optional sound when timer completes
- **Background Persistence**: Continue timer when navigating between screens using WorkManager
- **Exercise Database Integration**: Use actual Exercise entities for more precise categorization

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 4 Enhancements (Advanced Features)
- **Analytics Integration**: Track average rest times per exercise for insights
- **Adaptive Learning**: Suggest rest times based on user's historical patterns
- **Workout Context**: Shorter rests for volume work, longer for strength phases
- **1RM Integration**: Use actual 1RM data for precise intensity-based rest calculations

## Future Milestones

## Development Guidelines

- No comments unless explaining complex logic
- Follow Material Design 3 consistently
- Test edge cases (empty states, long text, errors)
- Atomic commits with descriptive messages
- Update CLAUDE.md for architectural changes

## Known Technical Gotchas

### LazyColumn with Keys
- When using `key` parameter, item composables maintain identity across recompositions
- Drag handlers can capture stale state references - always access current state from ViewModel
- Use `items()` instead of `itemsIndexed()` when indices need dynamic calculation

### State Management in Drag Operations
- Exercise order must be updated both in UI state and database
- Use `copy()` to ensure immutable updates with correct exerciseOrder values
- Database updates should be async to maintain smooth UI animations

### Compose Recomposition
- Heavy logging in frequently recomposing components impacts performance
- Use `derivedStateOf` for expensive calculations based on changing state
- Remember to clean up drag state completely on drag end to prevent inconsistencies

### Database Development Strategy
- Using `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` during development for simplicity
- All data is re-seeded on schema changes to avoid migration complexity
- Usage counts are recalculated after seeding to ensure accurate frequency data
