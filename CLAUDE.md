- **Exercise Resolution**: Fuzzy matching system with confidence scoring and alternative suggestions
- **Programme Validation**: Comprehensive validation engine with automated issue detection
- **Bulk Editing**: Programme-wide adjustments (volume, beginner mode, progressive overload)
- **Regeneration Options**: 6 different regeneration modes (full regenerate, keep structure, alternative approach, fix validation, more variety, simpler version)
- **Professional UI/UX**: Complete preview system with week selection, workout cards, and action buttons

**âœ… Technical Architecture:**
- **Data Models**: Complete type-safe models for AI responses, programme previews, and validation
- **State Management**: Cross-screen state sharing with GeneratedProgrammeHolder
- **Exercise Matching**: Intelligent exercise name matching with fuzzy logic
- **Validation Engine**: Volume guidelines, safety checks, and automated issue resolution

- **Exercise Alternatives**: One-click exercise swapping with confidence indicators
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable sections for bulk editing and regeneration options
- **Professional Polish**: Consistent styling, proper loading states, and error handling

**ðŸ”§ Critical UX Fixes (Current Session):**

**1. Fixed Broken Fix Button System:**
- **Problem**: Fix buttons appeared for exercise resolution issues that require human judgment, but clicking them did nothing
- **Root Cause**: Exercise matching requires manual user selection, cannot be auto-fixed by system
- **Solution**: Complete validation system redesign:
  - Added `isAutoFixable: Boolean` property to `ValidationError`
  - Exercise resolution errors marked as `isAutoFixable = false` 
  - Fix buttons only show for truly auto-fixable issues (volume, balance, etc.)
  - Top-level Fix button only appears when auto-fixable issues exist

**2. Fixed Validation Score Update Bug:**
- **Problem**: Validation score stayed at 0% even after users resolved exercise matching issues
- **Root Cause**: Score calculation was binary (0% if any errors exist)
- **Solution**: Implemented proportional penalty system:
  - Score = `(baseScore - unresolvedExercises * 0.2f).coerceAtLeast(0.0f)`
  - Score updates in real-time as users resolve exercises
  - More nuanced feedback instead of always showing 0%

**3. Improved User Guidance System:**
- **Problem**: Confusing Fix buttons and unclear messaging about what users need to do
- **Solution**: Clear, actionable guidance:
  - Error messages: "Scroll down and click on exercises highlighted in red to resolve them"
  - Help text: "ðŸ’¡ Scroll down to find exercises highlighted in red and click them to select correct matches"
  - Visual distinction between auto-fixable and manual-fix-required issues
  - No more misleading Fix buttons for human-judgment tasks

**4. Smart Validation Logic:**
- **Auto-fixable Issues**: Volume problems, balance issues, progression gaps (show Fix buttons)
- **Manual Resolution Required**: Exercise matching, exercise selection (show guidance only)
- **Real-time Updates**: Validation re-runs immediately after user actions
- **Proportional Scoring**: Gradual score improvement as issues are resolved

**ðŸ”„ Technical Implementation Details:**
- **ValidationError Model**: Added `isAutoFixable: Boolean` property for UI logic
- **Score Calculation**: Changed from binary to proportional: `(baseScore - unresolvedCount * 0.2f).coerceAtLeast(0.0f)`
- **UI Components**: Enhanced ValidationResultCard with smart Fix button visibility
- **State Management**: Real-time validation updates after exercise resolution
- **User Guidance**: Context-sensitive help messages for different issue types

   - **Priority**: Medium (affects user understanding but doesn't break functionality)

2. **UI Polish Needed**:
   - Analytics cards have text overflow issues (exercise names truncated, "days/" instead of "days/week")
   - Programme screen could use better workout preview cards
   - History screen pagination could be smoother

## Key Technical Decisions & Patterns

### UI/UX Philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Removed expand/collapse complexity in favor of always-visible controls
- **Context Awareness**: Different timer controls for different contexts (Â±30s main, Â±15s compact)
- **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent rest suggestions reduce user decision fatigue
- **Visual Feedback**: Haptic feedback for important actions, smooth animations
- **Information Hierarchy**: Most important info (timer, reps, weight) always prominent

### State Management Patterns
- **ViewModel Hoisting**: App-level ViewModels (RestTimer) for cross-screen state
- **Repository Pattern**: Single source of truth for all data operations
- **Flow & StateFlow**: Reactive UI updates with proper lifecycle handling
- **Optimistic UI**: Update UI immediately, sync database asynchronously

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Pagination in History screen
- **Key-based LazyColumn**: Proper item identity for smooth animations
- **Destructive Migration**: Fast development iteration, production will need proper migrations
- **Selective Recomposition**: Careful state structuring to minimize recompositions

## Development Guidelines

- No comments unless explaining complex logic
- Follow Material Design 3 consistently
- Test edge cases (empty states, long text, errors)
- Atomic commits with descriptive messages
- Update CLAUDE.md for architectural changes
- Use ViewModel factory pattern for ViewModels requiring context/dependencies
- Prefer composition over inheritance in UI components

## Known Technical Gotchas

### LazyColumn with Keys
- When using `key` parameter, item composables maintain identity across recompositions
- Drag handlers can capture stale state references - always access current state from ViewModel
- Use `items()` instead of `itemsIndexed()` when indices need dynamic calculation

### State Management in Drag Operations
- Exercise order must be updated both in UI state and database
- Use `copy()` to ensure immutable updates with correct exerciseOrder values
- Database updates should be async to maintain smooth UI animations

### Compose Recomposition
- Heavy logging in frequently recomposing components impacts performance
- Use `derivedStateOf` for expensive calculations based on changing state
- Remember to clean up drag state completely on drag end to prevent inconsistencies

### Database Development Strategy
- Using `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` during development for simplicity
- All data is re-seeded on schema changes to avoid migration complexity
- Usage counts are recalculated after seeding to ensure accurate frequency data

## Development Workflow

- Don't commit to Git. I do that myself.
- Always build the code base before saying that you've completed a task.

## Session Summary: AI Programme Generation UX Overhaul

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Focus**: Fixed critical UX issues in AI Programme Generation system

### âœ… Problems Solved Today:

1. **Broken Fix Buttons**: Removed misleading Fix buttons for exercise resolution (requires human judgment)
2. **Validation Score Bug**: Fixed score staying at 0% - now updates proportionally as issues are resolved  
3. **Confusing UI**: Replaced broken buttons with clear, actionable user guidance
4. **Smart Validation**: Distinguish auto-fixable vs manual-fix-required issues

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made:

- **ValidationError Model**: Added `isAutoFixable: Boolean` property
- **Score Calculation**: Proportional penalties instead of binary 0%/100%
- **UI Logic**: Fix buttons only show for truly auto-fixable issues
- **User Guidance**: Context-sensitive help messages and visual indicators

### ðŸ“‹ Identified for Next Session:

- **Validation Score Clarity**: Add tooltip/explanation for percentage score next to validation status
- **Real AI Integration**: Replace mock service with actual LLM integration

### ðŸŽ¯ Current State:
AI Programme Generation system now has proper UX with working validation, appropriate Fix buttons, and clear user guidance. Ready for real AI integration and minor polish improvements.
